# Project Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a jump-off point for any future golang based work.

Ideally, this server will fulfill two major functions:

1. Database Connection
2. User Management and Authentication

While also providing a clear pattern for future development/standards in regard to:

1. API Design
2. Testing Style and Coverage
3. External Service Integration

So that future Luke will be able to clone this repo and quickly get to work on whatever idea he has.
